The code is heavily inspired by the classic discontinued open-source [GABB External](https://github.com/SrMotion/GABB-Source) by SrMotion.

## Requirements
The `pprint` library is a built-in Python library. If itâ€™s missing by any chance, you can install it by running the following command in your command prompt:
```
pip install pprint
```
## Execution
Before running the `.py` file, make sure to update the `DAT_FILE_PATH` constant in the first few lines of the script.
## DISCLAIMER
Please note that this code is not fully functional. If you encounter any issues, you may need to troubleshoot or wait for future updates. :)
