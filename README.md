# Growtopia Save.dat file decoder

This Python script attempts to decode and display the values from the save.dat file.

Heavily inspired by the classic discontinued open-source [GABB External](https://github.com/SrMotion/GABB-Source) by SrMotion.


## Requirements
no libraries were used.

## Execution
Before running the `.py` file, make sure to update the `DAT_FILE_PATH` constant in the first few lines of the script.
## DISCLAIMER
Please note that this code is not fully functional. If you encounter any issues, you may need to troubleshoot or wait for future updates. :)
